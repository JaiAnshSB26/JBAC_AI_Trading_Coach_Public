- ✅ Only `.env.example` templates remain (safe)
- ✅ Added comprehensive `.env*` patterns to `.gitignore`

### 5. **Enhanced .gitignore**
- ✅ Added comprehensive patterns for:
  - Environment files (`.env`, `.env.*`)
  - Private keys (`*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`)
  - Credentials files (`*secret*`, `*credentials*`, `secrets.json`)
  - Backup folders (`backup_*/`)
  - Build artifacts and dependencies
  - IDE and OS specific files

### 6. **Created Security Documentation**
- ✅ Created `SECURITY.md` with:
  - Complete setup instructions for all required credentials
  - Step-by-step guides for obtaining AWS keys, Google OAuth, JWT secrets
  - Security best practices
  - Pre-deployment checklist
  - Troubleshooting guide

### 7. **Lambda Package Verification**
- ✅ Verified `llm_agents/package/` and `backup_before_cleanup_*/` folders

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Repository Users

Users cloning this repository will need to:

1. **Configure AWS Credentials**
   - Create IAM user with appropriate permissions
   - Set up `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in `.env`

2. **Configure Google OAuth**
   - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID in Google Cloud Console
   - Add to environment files

3. **Generate JWT Secret**
   - Create secure random string for JWT token signing

4. **Set Up DynamoDB Tables**
   - Create required tables: Users, Portfolios, Trades

**All instructions are provided in `SECURITY.md`**

## 🔐 Git Safety

### .gitignore Protection

The `.gitignore` now prevents accidental commits of:
- ✅ `.env` files (all variations)
- ✅ Private keys (`.pem`, `.key`, etc.)
- ✅ Credentials files
- ✅ Backup folders
- ✅ Build artifacts containing sensitive data

### Recommended: Pre-commit Hook

Consider adding a pre-commit hook to scan for secrets:

```bash
# Install git-secrets
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws
```
